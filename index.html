    <!-- tricky interview question -->
    <!-- What placing <script> at bottom of <body> does -->
    <!-- Bottom of body
HTML parsing → DOM built → JS downloads → JS executes

Head + defer
HTML parsing + JS downloading (parallel)
→ DOM built
→ JS executes -->

    <!-- Pros

DOM is already loaded

No null DOM issues

Simple and works without defer

❌ Cons

HTML and JS are mixed together

Harder to manage multiple scripts

Execution order becomes unclear in large apps

Doesn’t scale well (bundlers, code splitting)

Still blocks rendering at the end -->
